The submarine skeleton is old, and quite weathered. It is a small skeleton, looking like once this submarine could hold two people. You notice it looks like there are several holes penetrating the outside shell. Most of the panels are gone now, but the ones that remain appear to have been riveted together. The interior of the submarine has been almost completely destroyed by the elements. Upon closer inspection, one of the panels has the inscription: "Sarah I'm sorry" carved into it in a haphazard script.
