The submarine skeleton is old, and quite weathered. It is a small shell, looking like once this submarine could hold two people. You notice it looks like there are several holes penetrating the outside panels. Most of the panels are gone now, but the ones that remain appear to have been riveted together. The interior of the submarine has been almost completely destroyed by the elements. Upon closer inspection, one of the panels bears the inscription: "SS Atlantis".
