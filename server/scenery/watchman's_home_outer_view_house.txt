The small cottage is rather quaint and appears to be somewhat maintained. It is a one story house contained on a floating platform. The exterior walls of the house are painted white, and you notice that there appears to be a picket fence which surrounds the structure. You can't tell from this distance whether anyone appears to be there or not.
