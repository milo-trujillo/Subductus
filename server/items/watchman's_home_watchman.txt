"Greetings, sea lubber! Are ye here to fix the tower?"**"Nice weather of late, don't ye think?"** "Did ye notice the chrysanthemums? Planted em meself."**"M'names Alton. I'm the Watchman. I get paid t'watch th' tower. Ain't tha' a riot?"**"Heck if I know what the tower does. All I'm suppos' t'do is watch it. Tha's why they call me th' Watchman."**"Ye didn't come to fix the tower, did ye?"**"Wonder what I'll make for dinner t'night. Do ye like stew?"**"Ya wanna know th' secret o' stayin' young? Beets! Ate 'em evr'y night for dinner for the past twenty years!"**"Me Ma used t'make beet stew. Aye, what a stew she used t'make! Would bring all the lads from cities leagues around!"**"Tis been a while since I last saw the likes o' another human bein'. Such is th' life o' th' Watchman."**"Ya ever hear the sea shanty about th' Watchman who marries th' mermaid? Me neither!"**"I gave me heart to a mermaid once. Stay away from th' fish-women's my advice. They ain't nothin' but a sea o' troubles."**"Heard there's a storm on the horizon."**"If ye take a look upstairs, ye'll find what really shivers me timbers!"**"Ya know, I used t'have a life before bein' a watchman an' all. Tis a shame I can't remember much of it anymore."**"Bein a watchman ain't so hard. Alls I gotta do is get up evr'y mornin' an' watch the tower."**"Oh I get by wells enough, I'll tell ya. They gave me enough beets to last me the next hundred years!"**"Me thinks the thing I miss most about my home is going adventurin'. Ain't nothin' like undersea adventures. Too bad they made me come here t'watch th' tower."**"D'ya ever think that the mermaids are watchin' us?"**"Have ye ever tasted beet stew before? Ye should stick around and try some!"**"I'll tell ye th' secret o' me beet stew: beets, beets and more beets!"**"Beet broth, beet cream, beet butter, beet bread, aye, the only thing a sea dog needs is beets! If ye stick around, I'll even let ya taste a bit o' the beet beer, heh, heh..."**"Aye, bein' a watchman tis quite lonely. Can't remember the last time I felt a woman's warm embrace."**"Th' only thing I ca' remember is th' last day. I musta been twenty. They came for me an' took me away and said I was to be the watchman now. N'more Meredith, n'more o' Tarnizure. Tied t'a life o' lonliness and the sea."**"Th'sea's a cruel mistress, but she can be a pretty lady too s'times."**"All this chatter makes me want some nice, beet stew."**"Fish? Why would I need fish? I got all the beets I could ever need!"**
